## What is in the PDB database?

The main repository of biomolecular structure info is the PDB < www.rcsb.org >.

Let's see what this database contains:

```{r}
stats <- read.csv("Data Export Summary.csv", row.names=1)
stats
```

> Q1: What percentage of structures in the PDB are solved by X-Ray and Electron Microscopy.

```{r}
as.numeric((stats$X.ray))
```

We need to get rid of the commas. Can you find a function to do this?
`gsub()` can be used. The g stands for global and sub stands for substitution (ie substitute all). 

sub(pattern, replacement, x) but they're still around quotes meaning they're characters, so use `as.numeric()` to make them numbers we can do math on.

```{r}
x <- stats$X.ray
sum( as.numeric(gsub(",", "", x)) )
```

Apply to all columns now by turning the previous code into a function: use `apply()` to work on the entire table of data.

```{r}
sumcomma <- function(x) {
  sum( as.numeric(gsub(",", "", x)) )
}

sumcomma(stats$X.ray)
```

```{r}
sumcomma(stats$Total)
```


```{r}
apply(stats, 2, sumcomma) / sumcomma(stats$Total)
```
84.13% of PDB structures are solved by X-ray and 9.21% are solved by EM.

```{r}
n.total <- sumcomma(stats$Total)
n.total
```

```{r}
sumcomma(stats$EM)
```

```{r}
apply(stats, 2, sumcomma)
```

> Q2: What proportion of structures in the PDB are protein?

```{r}
n.protein <- sumcomma(stats[1, "Total"])
n.protein
```

```{r}
n.protein/n.total
```

86.59% of structures in the PDB are protein.

In UniProt, there are 248,805,733 entries, which compared to the PDB protein entries (189750), means that there are only ~7% of known sequences with a known structure.

> Q3: Type HIV in the PDB website search box on the home page and determine how many HIV-1 protease structures are in the current PDB?


## Visualizing the HIV-1 protease structure

Mol* ("mol-star") viewer is now ubiquitous. The homepage link is here: https://molstar.org/viewer/ 

I want to insert my image from Mol* here.

> Q4: Water molecules normally have 3 atoms. Why do we see just one atom per water molecule in this structure?

Hydrogen is not shown because the atom is smaller than the resolution level.

> Q5: There is a critical “conserved” water molecule in the binding site. Can you identify this water molecule? What residue number does this water molecule have

The water molecule has 308 residue number.

## Working with bio3d package.

```{r}
library(bio3d)
```

```{r}
pdb <- read.pdb("1hsg")
pdb
```

```{r}
head(pdb$atom)
```

```{r}
pdbseq(pdb)[25]
```

## Predicting functional motions of a single structure

We can do a bioinformatics prediction of functional motions (i.e., flexibility/dynamics):

```{r}
pdb <- read.pdb("6s36")
pdb
```

```{r}
m <- nma(pdb)
plot(m)
# Normal mode analysis
```

```{r}
mktrj(m, file="adk_m7.pdb")
```


# Comparative Analysis of Protein Structures

Here we will work through a complete pipeline of analyses for a given protein family starting from one single database ID for a member of this family, all the way to a deeper understanding of structure, dynamics, and function.

```{r}
library(bio3d)
```


```{r}
id <- "1AKE_A"

aa <- get.seq(id)
aa
```

```{r}
b <- blast.pdb(aa)
```

```{r}
hits <- NULL
hits$pdb.id <- c('1AKE_A','6S36_A','6RZE_A','3HPR_A','1E4V_A','5EJE_A','1E4Y_A','3X2S_A','6HAP_A','6HAM_A','4K46_A','3GMT_A','4PZL_A')
```


```{r}
files <- get.pdb(hits$pdb.id, path="pdbs", split=TRUE, gzip=TRUE)
```

```{r}
pdbs <- pdbaln(files, fit = TRUE, exefile="msa")
```

Print out the alignment 
```{r}
pdbs
```

```{r}
# Perform PCA
pc.xray <- pca(pdbs)
plot(pc.xray)
```

```{r}
# Visualize first principal component
pc1 <- mktrj(pc.xray, pc=1, file="pc_1.pdb")
```
